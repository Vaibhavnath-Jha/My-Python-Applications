## 1. Automating MS Paint
We have all used *MS Paint* at some point in our lives, but its capabilites are limited... or so you thought.<br/> 
Using PyAutoGui library one can automate any application. For now I've tried to automate MS Paint to draw concentric circles and sqaures. The possibilites are endless.<br/>
The code and some example images can be found below:<br/>

## 2. Visualizing K-means Clustering 
K-means Clustering algorithm is one of the fundamental algorithms used in machine (Unsupervised) learning. It enables researchers to visualize hidden clusters in a random set of data, which in turn allows them to convert that random data into powerful information. Use Cases are ever expanding.<br/>
The code and some example images can be found below:<br/>
